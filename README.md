# Camera-Application-with-applied-filters
This Python-based camera application utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and Haar Cascade Classifiers for real-time image processing. It allows users to capture photos and apply various filters such as grayscale, edge detection, and blur. The integration of Haar Cascade enhances facial detection, making the application more interactive and efficient.
